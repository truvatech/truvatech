- 👋 Hi, I’m Yannick

I’m currently working on developing and deploying Docker based infrastructure to Amazon ECS & migrating my client's legacy solutions.

I'm looking to do the same for start-ups, small and medium sized businesses, and even large ones if your team needs extra DevOps, cloud-infrastructure support, or just a all-around general I.T Wizard

You can reach me by email yannick@ymrtech.com
