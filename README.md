# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Yannick

I.T Wiz, and Systems & Processes Engineer, with a solid background and understanding of both on-screen and off-screen technical matters

Looking for 100% remote, or Montreal based flexible hybrid opportunities, which would ideally include a part where I would be working remotely from Costa Rica during the months of Dec-March

Roles I am looking to fill ‚Äì Looking for an exiting team and opportunity, and not necessarily a specific title
 - Cloud Systems Engineer/Site Reliability Engineer/Platform Engineer/DevOps/Sysadmin/Cybersecurity Analyst ‚Äì for cloud providers, MSPs, or in-house for larger enterprise-grade industries and organizations 
 - CTO/Technology lead/IT Manager/Sysadmin  - for start-ups/smaller businesses
 - Hardware/software R&D, or something related to events, with audio/video/tech
 - Whatever ‚Äúrole‚Äù I organically take on in any sort of non-structured or decentralized/distributed team. I am open to ideas I might not have thought of already based on my profile and your opportunity, and I am always looking for opportunities to grow, learn, and push my boundaries.
I am not picky about official title as I realize It‚Äôs all semantics for the same type of grasp on technology, although, if there is an official title, I‚Äôd be extra happy if it includes Engineer, to reflect my academic history and generalized ‚Äúsystems thinking‚Äù mindset.

You can reach me by email yannick@ymrtech.com

Montreal Based

Fully billingual French & English. I also write/speak spanish fairly decently
