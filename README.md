# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Yannick

I.T Wiz, and Systems & Process (industrial) Engineer, with an abstract art piece for a background/life-experience, and deep understanding of both on-screen and off-screen technical matters

Looking for 100% remote, or Montreal based flexible hybrid opportunities, which would ideally include a part where I would be working remotely from Costa Rica during the months of Dec-March. My partner is from there and she has family and a home there and why should one wait until retirement to do like the "snowbirds" (Retired Quebecers who drive down to florida every winter), when I could work remotely from a tropical paradise!?  

Roles I am looking to fill ‚Äì Looking for an exiting team and opportunity, and not necessarily a specific title
 - Cloud Systems Engineer/Site Reliability Engineer/Platform Engineer/DevOps/Sysadmin/Cybersecurity Analyst ‚Äì for cloud providers, MSPs, or in-house for larger enterprise-grade industries and organizations 
 - CTO/Technology lead/IT Manager/Sysadmin  - for start-ups/smaller businesses
 - Hardware/software R&D, or something related to events, with audio/video/tech
 - Whatever ‚Äúrole‚Äù I organically take on in any sort of non-structured or decentralized/distributed team. I am open to ideas I might not have thought of already based on my profile and your opportunity, and I am always looking for opportunities to grow, learn, and push my boundaries.
I am not picky about official title as I realize It‚Äôs all semantics for the same type of grasp on technology, although, if there is one, I‚Äôd be extra happy if it includes Engineer, to reflect my academic history and generalized ‚Äúsystems thinking‚Äù mindset.

I've had clients, employers, or have worked with teams and entrepreneurs in various different industries in various ways. Some digitally, others operationally, and literally getting down to the the nitty-gritty with some others...
 - small-scale off-grid agriculture
 - retreat centers & festivals
 - start-ups and incubation spaces
 - sales & marketing
 - small scale manufacturing and prototyping
 - small, medium, and large administration-heavy businesses (offices, hospitals, warehouses, etc)
 - bars & nightclubs
 - retail shops and small restaurents
 - mechanics, machining, and welding shops
 - delivery & logistics
 - bitcoin mining & trading
 - various web-based businesses and products
