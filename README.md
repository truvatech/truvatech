- 👋 Hi, I’m Yannick

I.T Wizard, and Systems & Processes Engineer, with a solid background and understanding of both on-screen and off-screen technical matters. Recently moved back to my hometown of Montreal from across the country and am actively looking for work!

Roles I’d consider:
    • DevOps/DevSecOps/Site Reliability Engineer/Platform Engineer/Cybersecurity Analyst/etc
    • High level technical implementation & support/management
    • CTO/Tech lead  - for start-ups/small businesses
    • R&D, or something related to events, with audio/video/tech
    • Or whatever “role” I organically take on in any sort of non-structured or decentralized/distributed team
I am not picky about official title as I realize It’s all semantics for the same type of grasp on technology through the lenses of different vocabulary among different roles and industries.

You either get “IT” , or you don’t, despite the language used to express it, and I can assure you, I get IT, as well as a lot in general when it comes to anything related to physical world, especially technological/mechanical/electrical. Consciousness is still a mystery, though...

You can reach me by email yannick@ymrtech.com
