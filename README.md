- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Yannick

I am currently working on deploying docker based solutions to Amazon ECS, and working on kubernetes locally in order to easily deploy clusters to EKS if I felt the compute costs were worth it for my applications or for those of my small clients, or if I had to work with it within an organization.

Mostly migrating my client's legacy solutions to docker based containers on ECS/EC2 for ease with which to centralize monitoring, management and to offload some of the infrastructure security to the provider.

I am looking to do the same for start-ups, small and medium sized businesses, and even large ones if your team needs extra DevOps, cloud-infrastructure integration, management, and support, or if you just need an all-around general I.T. Wizard, I'm your guy!

You can reach me by email yannick@ymrtech.com
