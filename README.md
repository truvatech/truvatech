- 👋 Hi, I’m Yannick

I am currently working on developing and deploying Docker based solutions to Amazon ECS & Fargate.

Mostly migrating my client's legacy solutions for ease with which to centralize monitoring and management.

I am looking to do the same for start-ups, small and medium sized businesses, and even large ones if your team needs extra DevOps, cloud-infrastructure integration, management, and support, or if you just need an all-around general I.T. Wizard, I'm your guy!

You can reach me by email yannick@ymrtech.com
